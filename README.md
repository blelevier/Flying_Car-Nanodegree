# Flying Car - Udacity Nanodegree

This repository contains my projects for this program.

## Overview

In this program, you’ll learn the core concepts required to design and develop robots that fly.
Working with the quadrotor test platform and our custom flight simulator, you will implement
planning, control, and estimation solutions in Python and C++.

## Project 1: Backyard Flyer

Write event-driven code in Python to get your drone to takeoff, fly a predetermined path, and land in a simulated backyard environment.

## Project 2: 3D Motion Planning

Move beyond the backyard test grounds and fly your drone around a complex urban environment. To do so, you will load a map of a real city, plan a collision-free path between buildings, and watch your drone fly above city streets.

## Project 3: Building a Controller

Implement your very own nonlinear cascaded controller in C++. You will attempt different motions (slow, fast, slalom, etc.) and analyze performance under different conditions.

## Project 4: Estimation

Utilize sensor fusion and filtering. Design an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate attitude and position from IMU and GPS data of a flying robot. After doing so, you will have implemented the full-stack for aerial robot!

## Project 5: Fixed-Wing Control

Learn the dynamics of fixed-wing flight and apply what you’ve learned by writing code to control a fixed-wing aircraft in simulation.
